  abstract = "Access to primary research data is vital for the advancement of
              science. To extend the data types supported by community
              repositories, we built a prototype Image Data Resource (IDR) that
              collects and integrates imaging data acquired across many
              different imaging modalities. IDR links data from several imaging
              modalities, including high-content screening, super-resolution
              and time-lapse microscopy, digital pathology, public genetic or
              chemical databases, and cell and tissue phenotypes expressed
              using controlled ontologies. Using this integration, IDR
              facilitates the analysis of gene networks and reveals functional
              interactions that are inaccessible to individual studies. To
              enable re-analysis, we also established a computational resource
              based on Jupyter notebooks that allows remote access to the
              entire IDR. IDR is also an open source platform that others can
              use to publish their own image data. Thus IDR provides both a
              novel on-line resource and a software infrastructure that
              promotes and extends publication and re-analysis of scientific
              image data.",

abstract={The rapid pace of innovation in biological imaging and the diversity of its applications have prevented the establishment of a community-agreed standardized data format. We propose that complementing established open formats such as OME-TIFF and HDF5 with a next-generation file format such as Zarr will satisfy the majority of use cases in bioimaging. Critically, a common metadata format used in all these vessels can deliver truly findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable bioimaging data.},
